 You'll now be taken to the Clone Site page where you have a few cloning options. ![Cloner - Clone Site](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Cloner-Clone-Site.png)

1\. Enter the name for a new site to create  

2\. Or enter the name of site to replace  

3\. Click the Clone Site button


 _Create a new site_ lets you create a new site that will be a duplicate of the selected site. _Replace existing site_ lets you overwrite an existing site with a copy of the selected site. Begin entering the name of an existing site and an auto-complete list of sites will show, from which you can select one. Press the _Clone Site_ button to commence the cloning process. If you've selected to replace an existing site, you'll see a confirmation page asking if you want to proceed. Press the Continue button to proceed. Once the clone process is started, you'll see a status page notifying you of the progress.
